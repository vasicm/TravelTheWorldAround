	<p>What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you think
		of a cemetery? Contrary to the usual depiction of the cemeteries, the
		Merry Cemetery is not sad or gray, but abounding in colors and
		brimming with life. Well, not exactly.</p>
	<p>
		Merry Cemetery or <em>Cimitirul Vesel</em> is a cemetery located in
		the northern part of Romania, in a small village, behind the local
		church. It is renowned for its merry tombstones which depict the life
		of the decesed through captions and pictures. The founder of the
		cemetery is considered to be Stan Ioan Patras, a local artist, who
		carved the first tombstone in 1935. The uniqueness of this cemetery
		comes from the widespread belief, culturally prevalent inside the
		European society, that death is a celebratory occasion because it
		represents a moment filled with joy and hope for a better life.
	</p>
	<p>Some of the stories on the tombstones are very humorous, others
		are peculiar, while some are tragic because they represent lives cut
		off by accidents or diseases.</p>

	<p>Pop Dumitru has been in charge of creating these presumed
		masterpieces for over thirty years. When a person passes away, the
		family of the deceased asks the priest to make a cross, which he
		carves manually. The priest decides which pictures and verses will
		represent the life of the deceased. The point of the images and the
		poems is not to make fun of the graves or their occupants, although,
		to be honest, some of them might be a bit indiscreet because they
		speak of adultery, fondness for alcohol and hostility towards some
		members of the family. You would expect the relatives to be offended
		when they see the tombstones, but that's not the case. Pop Dimitru
		says : "These tombstones portray the real life of the person. If he
		enjoyed drinking, that's what we will write. If he enjoyed working,
		that's what we will paint. Everything that ends up on these tombstones
		is true, because there are no secrets in a small town."</p>
	<p>The verses on the gravestones are written in first person and
		while reading them, you feel as if you were talking to the person
		buried there. What you feel while reading them is that you got to know
		the tomb's tenant a bit better. One of the panels says:</p>
	<p>
		"I rest here,<br />Stefan is my name.<br />I used to drink a lot
		and that's why I'm still thirsty.<br />So you, who are visiting my
		resting place,<br />Leave some wine behind."
	</p>
	<p>Even if you can't read the verses in Romanian, you can still
		enjoy the stories the paintings are telling. Some of them have more
		than one painting, so they could illustrate several occasions in a
		person's life. One tomb has three images; the first one of a man and a
		woman in love, hugging each other; the second shows the man sitting at
		the table with a bottle in his hand, while the woman is sitting on her
		own in the corner; in the third one the man is looking back over his
		shoulder at his wife who is in another room with a different man.</p>
	<p>A lot of tombstones contain images of everyday life like people
		working in the fields, or things and people that they cared about
		during their life. "Their lives are the same, but they want their
		death to be different." Among the tragic stories are the ones of the
		deceased children, which are represented as angels or being surrounded
		by angels.</p>
	<p>The Merry Cemetery has around 700 graves, and although it's an
		extremely popular place, there is still enough space for the future
		occupants. One of them will be Pop Dumitru, who is training a couple
		of apprentices. "It can't be just anyone", he says. "They have three
		jobs to do. They have to be sculptors, painters and poets, all in
		one."</p>

	<p>The Merry Cemetery is an idea created by Ioan Stan Patras, the
		man who is resting here as well. His tombstone says that he created
		these lively headstones because he loved people and he wanted people
		to visit him, even after his death. Considering that the Merry
		Cemetery is one of the most visited destinations in Romania, we can
		say that he succeeded in his wish. This place is filled with belief
		that death is only another big adventure into the afterlife, another
		beginning; and every beginning needs a joyful celebration.</p>
