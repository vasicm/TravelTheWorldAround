 <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">Moscow Russia!&nbsp; Where does one begin with a travelogue on a place like this?&nbsp; In really never thought I would make it to Moscow.&nbsp; In fact, I never really thought I wanted to make it to Moscow.&nbsp; During our first five minutes after landing in Sheremetyevo International Airport, I was sure I wanted to get the hell OUT of Moscow!</p>
 <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">I had never seen a more chaotic scene in 
 any passport queue in my life.&nbsp; There were several thousand people 
 jammed in to about 5 kiosks with no lines or order whatsoever.&nbsp; We were 
 immediately swept in to a frenzy of bodies moving to one side of the 
 entry room.&nbsp; There were so many bodies that we could not control how we 
 were moving!&nbsp; Cokie was getting crushed!&nbsp; This was an incredibly 
 dangerous&nbsp;situation and my son’s&nbsp;safety was at risk.&nbsp; I did not know 
 what to do, so I screamed at the top of my lungs, “my child is being 
 killed!&nbsp; Stop! Stop! Stop!”&nbsp; I screamed many times and looked directly 
 at the armed border guard and started yelling directly at him!&nbsp;(I 
 thought this might be the end of my trip to&nbsp;Russia&nbsp;at this moment.) &nbsp;At 
 that time, something magical happened. &nbsp;The wave of human bodies 
 lightened up and the sea parted just like in the <i>Ten Commandments</i>.&nbsp;
  All People magically made way for my family (well, at least Cokie and 
 Som).&nbsp; Cokie and Som were allowed to jump to the front of the line and 
 clear immigration.&nbsp; As soon as I started to follow, I was clothes-lined 
 in the throat by a large immigrant man (I don’t think he was Russian) 
 and prevented from progressing.&nbsp; The woman and child were ok; the man 
 had to fight the line just like everyone else.</p>
 <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">I eventually made it through the line 
 about 30 minutes later after some pretty sneaky moves myself.&nbsp; I 
 basically jumped in front of another guy - as he was placing his 
 passport on the counter, I slipped mine in first and slid right 
 underneath him in to the line.&nbsp; I smiled at him and knew that he could 
 do nothing right in front of the immigration officer.&nbsp; I was just hoping
  that I would not meet him again outside as he was pissed!</p>
 <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">After paying about $60 for a porter to carry our bags about 10 meters (our first of many Moscow rip-offs…), we were on our way with our driver to our hotel.</p>
 <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">Moscow
  is by far the most expensive city on earth.&nbsp; Hotels generally go for 
 about $400 to $700 per night for 2 star standards.&nbsp; We lucked out and 
 got a nice 2-3 star hotel for about $200 per night.&nbsp; Our travel agent in
  Moscow who we were using for the rest of our Russia expedition could not believe we got a hotel near Red Square so cheap!</p>
 <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">Moscow is one of those cities that you can both love and hate at the same time. By the end of our week in Moscow,
  both Som and I hated it more than loved it.&nbsp; When we finally boarded 
 the Transsiberian Express train, we felt an immediate sense of relief 
 that we were finally out of Moscow.&nbsp; Even while we were still on the tracks at the Moscow Train Station, we felt that Moscow was finally over.&nbsp; But at the same time, we loved Moscow.&nbsp; The history and spectacular buildings and structures and experiences we had there will be fond memories for life.&nbsp; </p>
 <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">I will never forget the first time we strolled Red Square after midnight
  and several shots of quality Russian vodka.&nbsp; I will never forget 
 exploring Saint Basil’s Basilica (or as Cokie calls it, “the Candy 
 Castle”) and the convents and cathedrals throughout the city.&nbsp; It was 
 like a trip back through my history books, and I am really glad we spent
  a full week exploring the bowels of this phenomenal ….and 
 hate-able…city.</p>

 <p>Our first night strolling Red Square!&nbsp; To me this was nearly 
 momentous, having grown up during the peak of the Cold War.&nbsp; Strolling 
 (and even watching Cokie goose step!) through the old evil empire's 
 front yard was great.&nbsp; We hung out in the square doing vodka shots 
 (after all, it was cheaper than water...) until well in to the early

 occasions refused to take money from us.&nbsp; I had no idea why they were so
  rude - perhaps we simply had a simple misunderstanding.&nbsp; But two food 
 stalls refused to sell us any food at all, yet helped some local folks 
 who were immediately after us.&nbsp; So when Cokie rented this little buggy 
 for a couple laps around the park and started to plough through the 
 gardens of the park, I was not all that sympathetic and even laughed in 
 satisfaction.&nbsp; Som knew exactly what I meant.&nbsp; The man who rented us the

 <p style="text-align: right;">On our first day in Russia, before&nbsp;we even
  explored Moscow at all, we&nbsp;traveled several hours south of Moscow to 
 Serpukhov near Prioksko-Terrasny Nature Reserve.&nbsp; This beautiful old 
 Russian hamlet was an example of what Russia used to be like.&nbsp; Here we 
 are at Visochky Cathedral which is very rarely visited by tourists at 
 all.</p></div></td>

  an area without doing some sort of nature activity!&nbsp; On our first day 
 in Moscow, we arranged a driver to take us several hours south in to the
  Siberian wilderness of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ecotravel.ru/eng/tours/4/21/">Prioksko-Terrasny Reserve</a>
  to see the last herds of European Bison in this part of Europe. The 
 differences between these forest&nbsp;dwelling bovids and their
